# What is this repo?

This repository contains custom PKGBUILDs and patches for packages that I build manually on my system.

# What should you do with it?

Not sure about that. I have made it public for the sake of availability and easy access but I'm not sure
if anyone out there needs any of it and what for. Also, in this repo I don't make my best to write the nicest
and most cannonical code. You're welcome to submit patches, though :)
